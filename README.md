The page which was to be designed was the conference page designed by Cindy Shin on Behance but since we were asked to personnalise it I have changed some things like the content of the page but the desing is respected. The project has being built mainly with bootstrap, some CSS, HTML and a little of media queries. This project has been built in less than 3 days.
